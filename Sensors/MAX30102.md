# Connecting MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor to ESP32

## Overview



<table>

  <tr>
    <td>
      The MAX30102 is a high-sensitivity pulse oximeter and heart-rate sensor that operates via the I2C communication protocol. It's designed for wearable devices and can measure oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate with high accuracy.

### Components Required

- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **MAX30102 Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

### Pinout for MAX30102

The MAX30102 sensor module typically has six pins, but you'll use the following four:

1. **VIN**: Power supply (3.3V or 5V)
2. **GND**: Ground
3. **SDA**: I2C data line
4. **SCL**: I2C clock line

### Connections

To connect the MAX30102 sensor to the ESP32, follow these steps:

1. **VIN to 3.3V**: Connect the VIN pin of the MAX30102 to the 3.3V pin on the ESP32 (it can also work with 5V).
2. **GND to GND**: Connect the GND pin of the MAX30102 to a GND pin on the ESP32.
3. **SDA to GPIO 21**: Connect the SDA pin of the MAX30102 to GPIO 21 on the ESP32 (default I2C data pin).
4. **SCL to GPIO 22**: Connect the SCL pin of the MAX30102 to GPIO 22 on the ESP32 (default I2C clock pin).

### Wiring Diagram

Here is a simple wiring diagram for connecting the MAX30102 to the ESP32:

```
   MAX30102   ESP32
   --------   ------
   VIN    ->  3.3V
   GND    ->  GND
   SDA    ->  GPIO 21 (I2C Data)
   SCL    ->  GPIO 22 (I2C Clock)
```

### Installing the MAX30102 Library

Before using the MAX30102 with the ESP32, you need to install the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE:

1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
3. In the Library Manager, search for "MAX3010x".
4. Install the "MAX3010x" library by **SparkFun** or "Adafruit MAX30105" by **Adafruit**.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s an example code to read heart rate and SpO2 data from the MAX30102 sensor and display the values on the Serial Monitor:

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include "MAX30105.h"
#include "heartRate.h"

MAX30105 particleSensor;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin();

  if (!particleSensor.begin(Wire, I2C_SPEED_FAST)) {
    Serial.println("MAX30105 was not found. Please check wiring/power.");
    while (1);
  }

  particleSensor.setup(); // Configure sensor with default settings
  particleSensor.setPulseAmplitudeRed(0x0A); // Turn Red LED to low to indicate sensor is running
  particleSensor.setPulseAmplitudeGreen(0);  // Turn off Green LED
}

void loop() {
  long irValue = particleSensor.getIR();

  if (checkForBeat(irValue) == true) {
    // We sensed a beat!
    float beatsPerMinute = 60.0 / getTime();
    Serial.print("Heart Rate: ");
    Serial.print(beatsPerMinute);
    Serial.println(" BPM");
  }

  delay(100); // Let's wait for 100ms
}
```

### Uploading and Testing

1. Connect your ESP32 to the computer using a USB cable.
2. Upload the code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) to view the heart rate and other readings from the MAX30102 sensor.

### Troubleshooting

- **Sensor Not Detected**: Ensure the correct wiring and check that the sensor is powered on.
- **Inaccurate Readings**: Ensure that the sensor is properly placed on your finger and that there is minimal movement during measurement.
- **No Data**: Double-check the I2C connections, and ensure that the correct pins are used for SDA and SCL.
