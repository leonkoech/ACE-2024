## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **ESP32-CAM Module**
- **FTDI Programmer or USB to TTL Serial Adapter**
- **Micro-USB Cable**
- **Computer with Arduino IDE (or any other compatible IDE)**
- **ESP32 Board Manager installed in the IDE**
- **Wi-Fi network (for Wi-Fi-based projects)**

### Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE:**
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `File > Preferences`.
   - In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add the following URL:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`.
   - Search for "ESP32" and click "Install".

3. **Set Up the ESP32-CAM Board:**
   - Connect your ESP32-CAM board to the FTDI programmer using the following connections:
     - **VCC** to **3.3V**
     - **GND** to **GND**
     - **U0R** to **TX**
     - **U0T** to **RX**
     - **GND** (on FTDI) to **IO0** (on ESP32-CAM) for programming mode.
   - Connect the FTDI programmer to your computer using the micro-USB cable.
   - Go to `Tools > Board` and select "AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM".
   - Select the correct port under `Tools > Port`.

### Pinout Diagram

The diagram below shows the pinout of the ESP32-CAM. Use General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) Pins to receive input from sensors or control peripherals.

### Writing and Uploading Code

1. **Open Arduino IDE:**
   - Create a new sketch or open an existing one.
   
2. **Basic Camera Web Server Example:**
   - Open the "CameraWebServer" example by going to `File > Examples > ESP32 > Camera > CameraWebServer`.
   - Configure the settings in the code, such as Wi-Fi SSID and password.

     ```cpp
     const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
     const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
     ```

3. **Upload the Code:**
   - Hold the **IO0** button on the ESP32-CAM module and click the upload button (right arrow) in the Arduino IDE.
   - Release the **IO0** button once the upload starts.
   - Wait for the code to compile and upload to the ESP32-CAM.

4. **Monitor Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor (`Tools > Serial Monitor`) to view any output from the ESP32-CAM, including the IP address for accessing the camera stream.

### Wi-Fi Example

The "CameraWebServer" example already sets up Wi-Fi to stream video. Hereâ€™s a basic example to connect to a Wi-Fi network without using the camera:

1. **Wi-Fi Connection Example:**
   - Use the following code to connect to Wi-Fi:

     ```cpp
     #include <WiFi.h>

     const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
     const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";

     void setup() {
       Serial.begin(115200);
       WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

       while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
         delay(1000);
         Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi...");
       }

       Serial.println("Connected to WiFi");
     }

     void loop() {
       // Your code here
     }
     ```

2. **Replace with your Network Credentials:**
   - Replace `"your_SSID"` and `"your_PASSWORD"` with your actual Wi-Fi network name and password.

3. **Upload and Monitor:**
   - Upload the code and open the Serial Monitor to see the connection status.

### Troubleshooting

- **ESP32-CAM Not Detected:**
  - Ensure that the correct port is selected.
  - Check the wiring between the ESP32-CAM and FTDI programmer.
  - Hold the **IO0** button during the upload process to enter programming mode.

- **Camera Issues:**
  - Double-check the camera module connection to the board.
  - Ensure the correct camera model is selected in the code.

## Power Management

The ESP32-CAM supports various power-saving modes, including deep sleep and light sleep. These can be useful for battery-powered applications.

### Deep Sleep Example

```cpp
void setup() {
  esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(10 * 1000000); // Wake up after 10 seconds
  esp_deep_sleep_start();                      // Enter deep sleep
}

void loop() {
  // This will not be executed until wake-up
}
```

## Conclusion

The ESP32-CAM is a versatile and powerful microcontroller with a camera module, suitable for various projects, especially those involving video streaming and image processing. Whether you're building an IoT device or experimenting with embedded systems, the ESP32-CAM provides the capabilities you need.
